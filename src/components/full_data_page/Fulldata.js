                    <p>The needs of a computer programmer and the features they demand from a programming
                        language keep on changing with time. Once C was supposed to be answer to all the questions in
                        programming. Though to some extent it is true, yet the need of simpler programming languages
                        was immediately felt. This very fact has compelled the programming language designers to
                        continuously revise the existing programming languages. The rapid pace of improvements in
                        related technologies demands that programming tools must improve even more rapidly to catch
                        up with them. This is a continuous process and in this process comes a point where a revised
                        version of a language is so much detached from the original counterpart that it takes form of an
                        altogether new language.
